-- Graduated Game is a multi-player Supreme Commander mod that adds 
-- a new balance element to the game. All players start with only the 
-- ability to build at Tech 1 and advance their tech level as they play. 
--
-- Tech levels advance when players engage in combat, essentially with 
-- a player's Kills + Deaths. In a three player game, if two players attack 
-- each other they will advance equally, but the third player will remain 
-- at a low tech level. This forces all players to get in to the fight early.
--
-- In addition to motivating all players to become involved in combat it 
-- gives players the opportunity to battle with lower tech units and build 
-- up to the big stuff. You will need to develop new strategies as you advance 
-- through the levels of tech.
-- 
-- Advancement is weighted by the cost of the units, so killing or loosing 
-- scouts won't advance you as fast as killing heavy tanks or buildings. 
-- Each player's progress can also be seen when the scores dialog is brought 
-- up (F2).
